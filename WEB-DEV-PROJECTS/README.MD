# Web Development Projects

Add your web project folders here. Each project should live in its own directory named clearly (preferably the project name or your full name).

## Example projects

- Project-1: Portfolio
- Project-2: News Website

## What to include for each project

For each web project include at least:

- A short `README.md` inside the project folder describing the project (one-paragraph summary and link to demo if available).
- The source code (e.g., `index.html`, `styles/`, `scripts/`, or a framework project structure like `src/`, `public/`).
- `package.json` if you use Node.js tooling, or a `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` if using a Python backend.
- Build instructions and how to run locally (see template below).

## Project README template (suggested)

```md
# Project Title

Short description (2-3 sentences).

## Demo
- Live demo: https://your-hosted-site.example (if available)

## Files
- `index.html` — entry page
- `styles/` — CSS files
- `scripts/` — JavaScript files
- `README.md` — this file

## How to run locally
```bash
# If it's a static site, open `index.html` in a browser or run a local server:
python -m http.server 8000  # then open http://localhost:8000

# If using Node.js (example):
npm install
npm run dev
```

```

## Notes

- Add a short section with deployment instructions (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages) if you deployed the project.
- Include links to any APIs or datasets used.
